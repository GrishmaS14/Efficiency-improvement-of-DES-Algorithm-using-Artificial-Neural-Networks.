The Purpose of cryptography is to change the data into unreadable form to prevent the access from any third person. In cryptography the data or information is transferred from the sender to receiver in a way which is encrypted and no unauthorized user can access it. There are various algorithms in cryptography which is based on number theory. Artificial Neural Network (ANN) is a computational model which is based on the human neuron system. The features of ANN include learning and modelling complex and non-linear data, generalization, fast data processing, no conditions on input data, easy execution and availability of hardware/software. In this paper we compare the execution time of DES and DES using ANN. Hence, we execute DES using ANN to reduce the execution time.
